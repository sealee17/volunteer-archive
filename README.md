# Volunteer Archive (Starter)

This is a ready-to-run React + Vite + Tailwind starter matching your folder style
(Pages, Components, Layout).

## Run locally
```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

## Where to paste content from your PDF
- Put page content into files under `src/Pages/*`
- Put reusable UI into `src/Components/*`
- Wrap site nav in `src/Layout.jsx`
- Detail page at `src/EntryDetail/EntryDetail.jsx`

## Next step (backend)
Add an `/api` folder with serverless endpoints or deploy on Vercel and use Vercel Functions.
Then wire to Supabase for DB and storage.
